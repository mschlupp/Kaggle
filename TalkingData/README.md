# TalkingData competition
The goal is to predict the gender and age of the customers.
I am going to document all the steps in Jupyter notebooks.

## Notebooks:

* Understand_Data: 
   - Investigate what's in the gender_age and phone_brand_device_model files. 
   - Do a few plots to get a feeling of the distributions 
   - Merge gender_age and phone files as well as the test and training sets
   - Use the merged data in a new notebook to create new features with which a first model can be trained
